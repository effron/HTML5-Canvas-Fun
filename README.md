=================
Having too much fun with AppAcademy's circles demo. Changed it from displaying random circles 
to a full fledged mesmerizing animation. Just download the files to your computer, and open
`index.html` in your browser. Enjoy! Feel free to play around with the Circle's default values, 
and see what fun animations you can make.
